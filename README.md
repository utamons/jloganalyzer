# jloganalyzer

My own log analyzer.

I needed some tool for filtering logs. I found that Perl is ugly, and awk requires a lot of time to learn, 
before I would be able to achieve my goals with it.

So I stopped with Java. It takes less time to me to implement all I need comparing to use Perl/awk.
And that fun after all..

...still under construction
